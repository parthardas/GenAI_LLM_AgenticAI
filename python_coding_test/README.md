# Third Grader Math Quiz – Powered by LLaMA3

This is a Streamlit-based web application that generates multiple-choice math questions for third graders using the LLaMA3 language model via Groq API. The app ensures questions are not repeated and provides instant feedback and explanations for each answer.

## Features

- **AI-generated MCQs:** Each question is generated by LLaMA3 and tailored for third-grade math.
- **No repeats:** The app tracks previous questions and instructs the LLM not to repeat them.
- **Immediate feedback:** After submitting an answer, you get instant feedback and a short explanation.
- **Score tracking:** Your score and question count are displayed throughout the quiz.
- **Simple UI:** Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
